Thank you for choosing Ruby Hub Functions! I created this to help script developers make their scripts more efficiently and without having to write to many struggling functions. As said above, Ruby Hub Functions is completely free and will stay that way permanently. We run purely off of donations and gladly accept them of any size. \
